# sm-js-runner

A script meant to interact with smlua in a way which helps themers.

This is not ready and does nothing yet.

## How to run

After installing all dependancies with `npm i` run `node src/index.js`, you should see the files that loaded with your console.

## What is the target?

Allow themers to use this package to read an entire theme without edits and be able to look at individual screens, return value from "engine" functions, amount of actorts on a screen and such.

I don't have any theming experience besides changing some stuff but I will try it.
